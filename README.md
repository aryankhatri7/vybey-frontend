# VYBEY — Demo E-Commerce Website  
*(Learning & Demonstration Project)*

VYBEY is a demo e-commerce style website created as a **personal learning project**.  
The goal of this project was to understand how a **complete frontend + backend system** works together — from UI design to API integration and deployment.

This project was built with the help of **AI tools (ChatGPT)** for code generation and debugging.  
My focus was on understanding the **overall structure, flow, deployment process, and real-world issues** while building a full-stack style application.

I actively experimented, broke things, fixed errors, and learned how different parts connect in a real environment.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

I am a **B.Com 1st year student** learning **AI and Digital Marketing**.  
As part of my practical learning, I built this project to understand:

- How websites are structured
- How frontend connects with backend APIs
- How data is fetched and displayed dynamically
- How images are handled using cloud storage
- How deployment works in a real hosting environment
- How common bugs and deployment issues are resolved

> ⚠️ This project is created **only for learning and demonstration purposes**, not for commercial use.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Used

### Frontend
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap (for layout & responsiveness)

### Backend (connected)
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Cloudinary (image uploads)

---

## ✨ Key Features

- Dynamic product listing using API
- Trending & Best Seller product sections
- Admin panel to add and delete products
- Cloudinary image upload support
- API-based data loading
- Error handling and filtering
- Deployed frontend + backend setup

---

## 🔗 API Integration (Used by Frontend)

- `GET /api/products` → Fetch all products  
- `GET /api/products?trending=true` → Fetch trending products  
- `GET /api/products?bestSeller=true` → Fetch best seller products  

The frontend consumes data from a **hosted backend API** and renders products dynamically on the UI.
