VYBEY — Demo E-Commerce Website (Learning Project)

VYBEY is a demo e-commerce style website created as a personal learning project.
The goal of this project was to understand how a complete frontend + backend website works together — from UI design to API and database integration.

This project was built with the help of AI tools (ChatGPT) for code generation and debugging, while I focused on structure, testing, deployment, and feature setup.

🎯 Project Purpose

I am a B.Com 1st year student learning AI and Digital Marketing.
As part of my learning, I wanted to practically understand:

How websites are structured

How backend APIs work

How products are stored in database

How frontend connects with backend

How deployment works in real environment

This project is created for learning and demonstration, not for commercial use.

MongoDB schema & filtering

Deployment issues & fixes

Debugging server errors

Connecting frontend with hosted backend

Using AI tools effectively for development

⚠️ Important Note

This project is AI-assisted.
Most of the code was generated and refined using ChatGPT, and then tested, modified, and deployed by me as part of my learning process.
